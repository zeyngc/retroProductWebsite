  <p>Makeup and beauty has shifted a lot from different eras. In the 1800s, Georgian makeup styles were prominent and colourful, but that shifted in the 1880s when Victorian culture dictated that makeup belonged on stage for actresses, or even more debauched, prostitutes. Makeup still was worn heavily, but it became a secret, where women would pass off makeup looks like winged eyes as having hooded eyelids, or things like a pale complexion being natural, rather than the work of blush and arsenic wafers. Here at Victorian Beauty Improvements, we embrace all the good, bad, and ugly that comes with Victorian era makeup. We have modified historic recipes to make them safer and more effective, and cheaper. Victorian beauty is no longer exclusive to those who can afford it. Our products strike a beautiful balance between quality and affordability, with a large selection of tones for all shades of Victorian women. Thank you for choosing Victorian Beauty Improvements!</p>
